<h2>Appendage whisp w/ pie</h2>
<h3>Poems: <a href="http://www.tangiblevortex.tumblr.com" title="External link to Simon Schlesinger">Simon Schlesinger</a> // Art: Marki Sveen</h3>

<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">[advice to a novice in the field]</h4>

<p>having fallen face first<br/>
into sixteen kinds of pies,<br/>
my most enthusiastic reccomendation<br/>
is to ensure that your cartilage<br/>
bends in confluence with the crust<br/>
rather than exercising its attempt<br/>
at free vectoral will, a practice<br/>
which will bend and sometimes even<br/>
crack that fragile form, most<br/>
unpleasant of a fate for any nasal<br/>
favouror inexperienced in facial pie dives.<br/>
of significantly less concern is the flavour.</p>

<h4>[Rutabaga Concept Condo]</h4>

<p>Imagine yourself inside of a rutabaga<br/>
its rooty inward-appendages gangling<br/>
about and whisping against your eyebrows.</p>

<p>Rather unpleasant bedding it’d make<br/>
but saleable, no? we’re talking total<br/>
submersion, which figures show they’re<br/>
all eating up. Yes, close your eyes<br/>
just to feel. I’ll breathe across your<br/>
face if you think that might help simulate<br/>
the feeling that Stan downstairs coined,<br/>
“appendage whisp” -- that’s the big sensoral<br/>
token, as we’ve been saying. But</p>

<p>when all is said and sold, how many folks<br/>
are going to fork over their savings, call<br/>
up their bankers, saying, “Barry, look,<br/>
we’ve got to have clearance on this one<br/>
or we’ll never get to live inside a rutabaga.”</p>

<h3>Top 12 oddball acts at the 2009 Austin, Texas fest</h3>
<h3>by Jesse Locke</h3>

<h2>1. Sun Araw</h2>
<div><img src="images/marki/sunaraw1.jpg" alt="Sun Araw at SXSW 2009" title="Marki Sveen - Sun Araw" style="width:290px;height:435px;float:left;" /> <img src="images/marki/sunaraw2.jpg" alt="Sun Araw at SXSW 2009" title="Marki Sveen - Sun Araw" style="width:290px;height:435px;float:left;padding-left:20px;" />
</div>
<p>In his stunning set at the Not Not Fun showcase, Sun Araw’s mustachioed main-man Cameron Stallones (also a member of heavy psych worshippers <a href="http://www.myspace.com/magiclanternmako" title="External link to Magic Lantern">Magic Lantern</a>) offered forth three extended tropical drone bliss-outs. Bathed in Sunn O))) amp reverb and Farfisa organ warble, he magically froze time like <a href="http://www.heroesfanatic.com/images/gallery/hiro-nakamura-photo.jpg" title="External link to Hiro">Hiro Nakamura</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Mi Ami</h2>

</div>
<p>Back in the ‘90s, Dischord-signed double bass guitar/drum-kit sporting, free-jazz loving quintet <a href="http://www.dischord.com/band/black-eyes" title="External link to Black Eyes">Black Eyes</a> were one of the baddest-assed bands around. These days, members Jacob Long and Daniel Martin-McCormick have regrouped as two-thirds of the hyperactive, banshee squealing trio Mi Ami, and guess what? Almost equal bad assery, bah gawd. As one of the last acts signed to the sadly defunct <a href="http://www.tgrec.com/" title="External link to Touch and Go">Touch &amp; Go</a>, their debut LP <em>Watersports</em> is one of this year's early stand-outs.</p>

<h2>3. Woods</h2>

</div>
<p>Imagine Neil Young and Crazy Horse reborn as a group of guitar freak-out and psych-folk loving early 20-somethings with some of the catchiest campfire holler-a-longs this side of circa now <a href="http://owlpellets.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.jpg" title="External link to Carmen Devendra">Devendra</a>, and you might have some idea of what to expect with Woods. Or maybe just <a href="http://www.woodenshjips.com/" title="External link to Wooden Shjips">Wooden Shjips</a> with twang and falsetto? Either way, these shaggily-sideburned Californian wunderkinds are so damn winning it’s almost unfair.</p>

<p>The formula for this Texas-based one-man freak show savant is simple on paper, but jaw-droppingly impressive in execution. Step 1: Whip off some blistering riffage on electric guitar. Step 2: Snag said riffs on Line 6 delay pedal and allow to ring out. Step 3: Jump onto drum kit and make like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdMDcG3zAEI" title="External link to Hella">Zach Hill</a>. Step 4: Somehow miraculously manage to sing monotone motivational <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJHQmJAiKA" title="External link to Gang Of Four">Gang Of Four</a>-style slogans into a head-attached mic while still flailing like a whirligig, all while foot-tapping the delay pedal like another percussive instrument. Step 5: Splatter audience brains across floor and walls.</p>

<p>Like M.I.A, <a href="http://images.uulyrics.com/cover/d/david-bowie/album-low.jpg" title="External link to Low">Low</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8TBmeK9Abg&amp;feature=related" title="External link to I Feel Love">&quot;I Feel Love&quot;</a> before them, Chicago/Brooklyn three-piece These Are Powers (featuring former Liars and <a href=" http://www.myspace.com/nothingsnyc" title="External link to n0 things">n0 things</a> member Pat Noecker on possibly the weirdest sounding bass guitar ever) offer a taste of the future. Describing their synth-drum and sample driven, mutant electro hip-hop hybrid is difficult in words that currently exist, so try these: GRAXX DRAZZLY WYBBB QUUUUVVV.</p>

<h2>6/7. Azeda Booth/Women</h2>
<div><img src="images/marki/azedabooth.jpg" alt="[IMAGE] Azeda Booth at SXSW 2009" title="Marki Sveen - Azeda Booth" style="padding-left:38px;width:525px;height:350px;" />
<img src="images/marki/women.jpg" alt="[IMAGE] This is a photo of Women at SXSW 2009" title="Marki Sveen - Women" style="padding-left:38px;width:525px;height:350px;" /></div>
<p>This pair aren’t linked up because of stylistic similarities—both play guitars, that’s about all they share—but because they’re both from Calgary, and seriously slayed at this year’s SXSW. At the annual Friend Island day party, the Azeda boys performed cuts spanning their back catalog and brand spankin’ new <a href=" http://www.azedabooth.com/ep/" title="External link to Tubtrek EP">Tubtrek EP</a>. Stranger and more exciting still, front man Jordon Hossack traded in his trademark falsetto for some bona-fide croons, while fellow band members Morgan Greenwood and Marc Rimmer provided the shimmering soundscapes underneath.</p>
<p>Women, on the other hand, were one of the most hyped acts at this year’s fest, and for good reason. Following their non-stop tour action of the last few years, the quartet have now honed themselves into crystalline panthers of post-punk destruction. With newer tracks like “Diamond Boy” and their cover of Devo’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPTCiRNeZeU" title="External link to Blockhead">&quot;Blockhead&quot;</a>, they easily outshone the now tragically past their prime <a href="http://www.rumorsinmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/devo.jpg" title="External link to Devo">flowerpot-hatted fogies</a> they paid tribute to.</p>

<h2>8. Ponytail</h2>

<p>Everyone and their dog has been barking about these Baltimoreans since the release of last year’s <em>Ice Cream Spiritual</em>, but hey, it’s basically impossible (and pointless) to find a fault in their stupidly fun sound. If you can’t get down with cascades of guitar, spasticus drumming and a cherub-like lead singer hopped up on Pixie Stix while spitting nonsense sound effects, then basically you don’t like music. Live, they make even more or possibly even less sense, depending on how you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok" title="External link to Grok">grok</a> it.</p>

<h2>9/10. Micachu/The Dirty Projectors</h2>
<div><img src="images/marki/micachu1.jpg" alt="[IMAGE] This is a photo of Micachu at SXSW 2009" title="Photo courtesy of Marki Sveen" style="width:290px;height:435px;float:left;" />

<p>It would be impressive enough just to know that she’s been a musician since age four, has mastered multiple instruments such as the violin and viola in post-secondary, composed a classical epic for the London Philharmonic Orchestra and invented her own kind of guitar (“The Chu” - see photo above). However, the fact that 21-year-old cutie-pie Mica Levi takes these skills and cranks out stupidly catchy and undeniably British bizarre-o pop songs makes you want to pick her up, put her in your backpack and buy her some candy (or a pint). Performing at Emo’s Annex, Levi and her band The Shapes opened for Dave Longstreth's Dirty Projectors, who also ruled it with their fourth world weirdness and <a href="http://elbo.ws/video/GIqSUG8RihY/" title="External link to Stillness Is The Move">Mariah Carey impressions.</a></p>

<h2>11. Talk Normal</h2>

</div> 
<p>With their awesome atonality, bored vox and guitar squawks, Brooklyn grrly girl No Wave duo Talk Normal conjure up the ghosts of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPb18CzG2gg" title="External link to James Chance">James Chance</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLUUDZdKxuA" title="External link to Lydia Lunch">Lydia Lunch</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZctJ3xhNFlw&amp;feature=related" title="External link to DNA">Arto Lindsay</a>, even though all three of them are still alive. Stick their <em>Secret Cog</em> EP in yr ear, it’s a real brainstormer.</p>

On album, Thee Oh Sees are a real cool time, but they still can't quite pound the nails into the coffin the same way Dwyer’s past projects <a href="http://www.myspace.com/coachwhipsvsfuckers" title="External link to Coachwhips">Coachwhips</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV-8jmxFgCQ" title="External link to Pink and Brown">Pink and Brown</a> used to. Live, however, it’s another story altogether. One about sloppy guitar shredding, spazzy rock ‘n’ roll and you leaving their show feeling like you just saw <a href="http://www.trcjt.ca/ab950/lizzy4/74germ01.jpg" title="External link to Phil Lynott">Thin Lizzy</a> obliterate a backyard BBQ.</p>
