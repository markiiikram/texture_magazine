<h2>New words for yes eyes</h2>

<h4>[a hero experiments with meatscience]</h4>

<p>The Lone Ranger's collection of luncheon meats<br/>
grew soggy as he watered its bucket-cum-home<br/>
despite the butcher's orders to minimize dampness.</p>

<p>Undaunted by a growth of film, his penchant<br/>
for saturated salami was punctuated<br/>
by the wet meat's still-salty flavour.</p> 

<p>Slick as it tumbled down his throat,<br/>
seven circular slices of salami grew enmeshed<br/>
in the Lone Ranger's digestive enzymes. The bucket,</p>

<p>still brimming with balogna and prosciutto,<br/>
dribbled ooze after three-days neglect. Tonto,<br/>
despite direct orders, refused to sponge up the goop.</p>

<p>Soon, as mould flourished, the Lone Ranger grew<br/>
amused at the spores' progress. He started to chart<br/>
the shapes and hues the meat took to, </p>

<p>insisting to his sidekick he'd discover a new colour.<br/>
Convinced the meatspores could carry respiratory illness,<br/>
Tonto reclused, refusing all the Lone Ranger's communications</p>

<p>from smoke signals to textos. Only when his account<br/>
slimmed to nil did Tonto shrink his stance<br/>
and wander back. Lonely Ranger, reclused and depraved</p>

<p>grew giddy seeing his sidekick's poncho slip past<br/>
the hill and flap as Tonto approached the Ranger's<br/>
shack. But with dismay, the Lone Ranger watched</p>

<p>as his otherwise-dependable sidekick picked up<br/>
the meatbucket and lugged that miniature swamp<br/>
out to the dumpster near the neighbours' cactus patch.</p> 

<h4>[Big Bob's radio address on the prospect of previously-owned tricycles]</h4>

<p>Look, we got a baker's dozen of these three<br/>
wheeled babies left -- that's thirteen for you<br/>
accountants out there. They're practically riding<br/>
themselves offa the lot, these trikes are so smooth,<br/>
fit for a clown of any build. Mimes and other performers<br/>
will appreciate the uptick in attention<br/>
that a fine three-wheeler can provide any performance<br/>
and the Magician's Guild has confirmed that several<br/>
of these exact trikes have helped lubricate<br/>
the suspension of disbelief in the early works<br/>
of several now-notable practitioners of the magical arts,<br/> 
Merlin Klondike Zipper and sir Joseph Weltube<br/>
among them. We have pictures as proof, down here<br/>
on the lot. Why don't you whiz on down here now,<br/>
clamp your hands on one of these beasts<br/>
before Cirque du Soleil arrives to scoop 'em all up<br/>
and i'll cut you a deal so deep it'll leave<br/>
your pockets sagging down past your cuffs as you ride off.</p>

<h2>Apendage whisp w/ pie</h2>

<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">[advice to a novice in the field]</h4>

<p>having fallen face first<br/>
into sixteen kinds of pies,<br/>
my most enthusiastic reccomendation<br/>
is to ensure that your cartilage<br/>
bends in confluence with the crust<br/>
rather than exercising its attempt<br/>
at free vectoral will, a practice<br/>
which will bend and sometimes even<br/>
crack that fragile form, most<br/>
unpleasant of a fate for any nasal<br/>
favouror inexperienced in facial pie dives.<br/>
of significantly less concern is the flavour.</p>

<h4>[Rutabaga Concept Condo]</h4>

<p>Imagine yourself inside of a rutabaga<br/>
its rooty inward-appendages gangling<br/>
about and whisping against your eyebrows.</p>

<p>Rather unpleasant bedding it’d make<br/>
but saleable, no? we’re talking total<br/>
submersion, which figures show they’re<br/>
all eating up. Yes, close your eyes<br/>
just to feel. I’ll breathe across your<br/>
face if you think that might help simulate<br/>
the feeling that Stan downstairs coined,<br/>
“appendage whisp” -- that’s the big sensoral<br/>
token, as we’ve been saying. But</p>

<p>when all is said and sold, how many folks<br/>
are going to fork over their savings, call<br/>
up their bankers, saying, “Barry, look,<br/>
we’ve got to have clearance on this one<br/>
or we’ll never get to live inside a rutabaga.”</p>

<h2>Polyesterhythmic pizza</h2>

<h4>[Shambles of a Scorecard]</h4>

<p>Stored in sports shorts, Lawrence’s<br/>
important scorecard folds fourway<br/>
into awkward geometries; muscles cramp<br/>
in compliance with the polyesterhythmic<br/>
stumbles and lunges embodied in his<br/>
squash service, especially while he<br/>
serves from behind. He keeps efficient</p>

<p>score, for each match his hopes ascend<br/>
that he’ll best that wretched Carl,<br/>
his oft-tested nemesis at whose hands<br/>
Lawrence always stands vanquished. “Six<br/>
t’your eight” he calls across to Carl<br/>
who shrugs spinning his racquet’s grip</p>

<p>between his fingertips. Lawrence slices<br/>
a serve that lobs against the side and stutters<br/>
into Carl's forward frollick; his beastly<br/>
forehand trickles a boast which bounds<br/>
beneath Lawrence’s toes amidst his stunning<br/>
forward thrust, Lawrence slides across the ball’s</p>

<p>face and falls sideways; his right knee<br/>
still pumping plants through his strings.<br/>
Lawrence winces, a tear aduct as he tugs<br/>
his crumpled scorecard up from his flimsy<br/>
pocket folds while staring Carl in the teeth<br/>
and tears sets one through three to shreds.</p>

<h4>[a slice of gregory's lot]</h4>

<p>motivational mumbo-jumbo spills from gregorys’s lips<br/>
alongside crumbs of crust and a sliver of melted<br/>
mozzarella. his truths curl around the calculus of<br/>
car-sales pitches; the slogans of sparkplugs, words<br/>
with meanings as malleable as the elasticity of his<br/>
chewing cheeks’ skin. what wonders a new life as<br/>
a self-identified convertible-owner can bring --<br/>
the wind, sweet as pineapple, is irresistable,<br/>
coos softer than even this dough, gregory<br/>
maintains, his slick words weaving an oily<br/>
patch on the paper napkin as he slides<br />
off his seat, racing to sell gooey hot dreams.</p>
